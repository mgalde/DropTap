# Hardware / Software requirements for DropTap

The DropTap makes use of a Raspberry Pi 3 witch it self requires a 32 GB microSDHC UHS-I card to contain the file system. This needs to be a class 10 device as speed will be a issue as the DropTap polls and displays information to a mobile user. The card used for the DropTap can be found [HERE ](https://www.amazon.com/Sandisk-Ultra-Micro-UHS-I-Adapter/dp/B073JWXGNT) which at this time is listed at $12.99.


The Raspberry Pi also needs a power adapter which is included in many Raspberry Pi kits so that the device can function.
